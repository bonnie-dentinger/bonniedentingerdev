                This website was a project for my Web Programming class. It is a website for a fictional company called PrismX, which helps provide exercises
                that help with identifying color-blindness. The website is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, FuelPHP, and MySQL and uses an API to generate
                color names. There is also functionality that allows the user to view a "printable" version of what they have created.

                The user starts by choosing any number of columns and rows (between 1 and 26), as well as colors (between 1 and 6). There is validation built in
                to verify that the user has entered a valid number and alerts the user if there is invalid entry.

            <p>
                The user can also select a specific color, and "color" the squares created in the grid below, which was generated using the number of columns 
                and rows selected by the user, by clicking on the squares. If the color is edited, then the colored squares will change to the new color. If 
                the color is deleted, then the colored squares will empty.
            </p>

                The user can then choose to edit, add, or delete colors as they choose. This is an example of adding a new color. The modals for adding, deleting,
                and editing were almost completely built using custom CSS and Javascript, beyond the base of Bootstrap modals.

                This is the "printable" view. The user can choose to print the page, which will print the grid as well as the colors used and which columns and
                rows were selected, battleship-style. The goal is top help the user use the color instructed to color in the squares.
